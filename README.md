# üöÄ MERN-Roadmap
## üëÄ **Disclaimer**
Please remember that, everyone is different, someone can learn quickly while someone cannot depending how their past were. Duration are not strict, take our time. Good things take time. Remember, the more time you give to your art, the better it will come out to be. You are an artist, make your time worth and create an art in this world. **Keep Learning**, **Small step at a time** 

## üôå **Suggestions**
- Learning something while doing side by side is the best way of learning.
- Start a project and experiment with what you have learned.
- Always plan the project then ask yourself how to make that real and learn in the process.
- You require to motivate yourself to keep doing it. Do a project, it will motivate you.
- Learn essentials parallelly ( e.g. Touch typing, you will type a lot ), ( Documentations, try to document what you develop along the way )
- Find your own resources of your test but learn that thing.
- Google things, talk with ChatGPT, make ChatGPT your best friend.

## üß© **Technology Used**
- **HTML**
- **CSS**
- **Javascript**
- **React.js**
- **Node.js**
- **Express.js**
- **Mongodb**
- **Mongoose**
- **JWT**
- **GITHUB**

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Prerequisites (1-2 Weeks)**
Before diving into MERN, ensure you have a strong foundation in:
- ‚úÖ **HTML, CSS, JavaScript (ES6+)** ‚Üí DOM manipulation, Flexbox, Grid, Promises, Async/Await ( I really suggest you create your own portfolio with plain HTML, CSS and Javascript to test yourself )
- ‚úÖ **Version Control (Git & GitHub)** ‚Üí Pushing, Pulling, Branching, Merging ( Use git from first project only, you will use it a lot and that is free practice )
- ‚úÖ **Basic Terminal & CLI Commands** ( Always try to run your code from terminal, It really teaches you a lot about how things work )
*Note: Your first week is going to be hetic as many things can overwhelm your motivation, please fight through it.*

## **2Ô∏è‚É£ Frontend Development with React (4-6 Weeks)**
### üîπ Learn **React Fundamentals**
- Components, Props, State, JSX
- React **Hooks & Context API** (useState, useEffect, useContext and many other are not used often)
- **React Router** (for navigation, a must to know skill in react )
- **Styled Components / TailwindCSS** (for UI styling, you can use any other as well if you want)
- **State Management** (Redux Toolkit / Zustand for advanced apps or just use Context in react)
- **API Calls with Axios / Fetch** (RESTful APIs integration)
- **Deploying React Apps** (Netlify, Vercel)
